# Doughy - Your open source dough calculator!

This app is created to make it as easy as possible to calculate your dough recipes. Use the default recipes that I have provided or add your favorite ones. This app uses bakers percentages to calculate your recipe for you, so make sure you read up on that. The intention of this app is to make it easy to calculate your recipes, but also to perfect them. Version 1.0 allows you to tweak your ingredient ratios and temperatures, but there will be a release soon that allows you to take notes on your recipes so you can keep a history of the tweaks you've made and the effects of those tweaks. Create the best possible bread, pizza, bagels, cake, anything! If it uses flour, you can calculate your recipe here.

# Features
- Completely 100% offline.
  - No data is stored outside of your phone, no logs, no metrics, I'm not collecting your recipes for myself.
- Scale up and down as much as you want
  - Did you just get an awesome pizza oven and now you want to scale your perfect 10" pizza to 16"? Increase the dough mass and with one click, you'll get your new recipes.
- Tweak everything, from the hydration level, any ingredient amount (determined by bakers percentage), or temperature.
- Create your own recipes!
  - Click the + button the home page to make your own base recipes, then tweak them as you go.
- Write/edit your instructions.
  - You can make your instructions as simple or detailed as you want. For now, you can even put notes on the recipe there.
- Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- Completely in the mass-based metric system
  - If you're using this app, you know volumetric baking is imprecise and leads to inconsistent results. Using grams for measurements also allows for finer precision of the ingredients.
